[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/9167b94cfaa248858c06734916682a36)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/goldstack/s3-terraform-typescript-boilerplate/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=goldstack/s3-terraform-typescript-boilerplate&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Boilerplate for setting up the infrastructure for AWS S3 using Terraform and working with S3 using a simple TypeScript API.

```typescript
const bucketName = await getBucketName();
const s3 = await connect();
await s3
  .putObject({
    Key: 'local.txt',
    Body: 'hello',
    Bucket: bucketName,
  })
  .promise();
```

This boilerplate has been automatically generated from the template:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p align="center"><a href="https://goldstack.party/templates/s3"><img width="50" src="https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202204/s3.svg"></a></p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Feel free to fork this repository and modify it for your needs, or use the [Goldstack project builder](https://goldstack.party/build) to generate a boilerplate specifically generated for your project.

‚ö†Ô∏è Before forking this boilerplate, consider if you would want to start with a project that contains a server template as well, such as [Serverless API](https://goldstack.party/templates/serverless-api) or [Serverless Express.js](https://goldstack.party/templates/express-lambda).

# Getting Started

Thank you for using this boilerplate. For any questions or feedback, please be welcome to [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/goldstack/goldstack/issues) ü§ó .

## 7. AWS Infrastructure Configuration

If you want to setup your S3 infrastructure on AWS, you will need to make some changes to the configuration files included in this project.

Specifically, the [goldstack.json](https://github.com/goldstack/s3-terraform-typescript-boilerplate/blob/master/packages/s3-1/goldstack.json) in the `packages/s3-1` folder.

```json
{
  "$schema": "./schemas/package.schema.json",
  "name": "s3",
  "template": "s3",
  "templateVersion": "0.1.0",
  "configuration": {},
  "deployments": [
    {
      "name": "prod",
      "awsRegion": "us-west-2",
      "awsUser": "goldstack-dev",
      "configuration": {
        "bucketName": "goldstack-test-s3-bucket"
      },
      "tfStateKey": "s3-prod-40dd578eab44b83dc601.tfstate",
      "tfVersion": "1.10"
    }
  ]
}
```

The key property you will need to update is:

- `deployments[0].configuration.bucketName`

You also need to _delete_ `deployments[0].tfStateKey`.

For more information on these configuration options, see [Goldstack Documentation / S3 / Configure](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/templates/s3#configure).

You will also need to ensure that you have a valid AWS user configure to deploy to AWS. For this, create a file in `/config/infra/config.json` (relative to project root).

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "goldstack-dev",
      "type": "apiKey",
      "config": {
        "awsAccessKeyId": "...",
        "awsSecretAccessKey": "...",
        "awsDefaultRegion": "us-west-2"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "goldstack-prod",
      "type": "apiKey",
      "config": {
        "awsAccessKeyId": "...",
        "awsSecretAccessKey": "",
        "awsDefaultRegion": "us-west-2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For more information on configuring your local AWS users, please see [Goldstack Documentation / AWS Configuration](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/goldstack/configuration#aws-configuration).

Once your AWS user is configured you can run `yarn infra up prod` in the `/packages/s3` folder. For more information on the infrastructure commands for this project, see [Goldstack Documentation / S3 / Infrastructure](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/templates/s3#infrastructure).

## 8. Local Development

This boilerplate will come with a module that provides the functionalities for working with S3. This module is defined in `packages/s3-1`. Generally you won't have to make changes to this module during local development. Instead, create an additional npm module in the `packages/` folder and then import the `s3` module as one of the dependencies.

Then use the exported `connect()` and `getBucketName()` in your code to write and read data from S3:

```typescript
    const bucketName = await getBucketName();
    const s3 = await connect();
    await s3
      .putObject({
        Key: 'local.txt',
        Body: 'hello',
        Bucket: bucketName,
      })
      .promise();
  });
```

The result of `await connect()` is an instance of [`AWS.S3`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html).
