  <p>The following key properties need to be configured for this template:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Hosted Zone Domain</strong>: A Route 53 hosted zone to which the
      <em>Primary Website Domain</em> and <em>Redirect Website Domain</em> can
      be added as records. For instance, the hosted zone domain
      <code class="inline">mysite.com</code> would allow adding the primary
      domain <code class="inline">mysite.com</code> and the redirect domain
      <code class="inline">www.mysite.com</code>. For more details, please check
      <a
        href="https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/goldstack/configuration#hosted-zone-configuration"
        class="absolute"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Hosted Zone Configuration</a
      >
      in the Goldstack documentation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Primary Website Domain</strong>: This is the domain your users
      will use to view the site. For instance, if you configure the domain
      <code class="inline">mysite.com</code>, users will be able to view your
      site by opening the URL <code class="inline">https://mysite.com</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Redirect Website Domain</strong>: This is a domain that will
      redirect all requests to your <em>Primary Website Domain</em>. The
      redirect website domain <em>must be</em> different to the
      <em>Primary Website Domain</em>. For instance, if you configure the domain
      <code class="inline">mysite.com</code> as your primary domain, you can
      configure <code class="inline">www.mysite.com</code> as your redirect
      domain. Users will be redirected to
      <code class="inline">https://mysite.com</code> when they attempt to open
      the URL <code class="inline">https://www.mysite.com</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Default Cache Duration</strong>: The number of seconds that files
      will be cached in the AWS content delivery network. Setting this to
      <code class="inline">120</code> for instance, would mean that, unless
      otherwise specified, webpages and other resources will be cached for 120
      s. In that case, when a new version of a page is deployed, it can take up
      to 120 s for changes to appear when accessing the deployed version of the
      application.
