All infrastructure for this module is defined in Terraform. You can find the Terraform files for this module in the directory `[moduleDir]/infra/aws`. You can define multiple deployments for this module, for instance for development, staging and production environments.

If you configured AWS deployment before downloading your project, the deployments and their respective configurations are defined in `[moduleDir]/goldstack.json`.

The configuration tool will define one deployment. This will be either `dev` or `prod` depending on your choice during project configuration. In the example `goldstack.json` below, a deployment with the name `dev` is defined.

```json
{
  "$schema": "./schemas/package.schema.json",
  "name": "...",
  "template": "...",
  "templateVersion": "...",
  "configuration": {},
  "deployments": [
    {
      "name": "dev",
      "awsRegion": "us-west-2",
      "awsUser": "awsUser",
      "configuration": {
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Infrastructure Commands

Infrastructure commands for this module can be run using `yarn`. There are four commands in total:

- `yarn infra up`: For standing up infrastructure.
- `yarn infra init`: For [initialising Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html).
- `yarn infra plan`: For running [Terraform plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html).
- `yarn infra apply`: For running [Terraform apply](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/apply.html).
- `yarn infra destroy`: For destroying all infrastructure using [Terraform destroy](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/destroy.html).

For each command, the deployment they should be applied to must be specified.

```bash
yarn infra [command] [deploymentName]
```

For instance, to stand up the infrastructure for the `dev` deployment, the following command would need to be issued:

```bash
yarn infra up dev
```

Generally you will only need to run `yarn infra up`. However, if you are familiar with Terraform and want more fine-grained control over the deployment of your infrastructure, you can also use the other commands as required.

### Customizing Terraform

Goldstack modules make it very easy to customize infrastructure to your specific needs. The easiest way to do this is to simply edit the `*.tf` files in the `infra/aws` folder. You can make the changes you need and then run `yarn infra up [deploymentName]` to apply the changes.

The `infra/aws` folder contains a file `variables.tf` that contains the variables required for your deployment; for instance the domain name for a website. The values for these variables are defined in the module's `goldstack.json` file in the `"configuration"` property. There is one global `configuration` property that applies for all deployments and each deployment also has its own `configuration` property. In order to add a new variable, add the variable to `variables.tf` and then add it to the configuration for your module or to the configurations for the deployments.

Note that due to JavaScript and Terraform using different conventions for naming variables, Goldstack applies a basic transformation to variable names. Camel-case variables names are converted to valid variables names for Terraform by replacing every instance of a capital letter `C` with `_c` in the variable name. For instance:

`myVariableName` in the Goldstack configuration will translate to the Terraform variable `my_variable_name` as defined in `variables.tf`.

### Terraform State

In order to manage your infrastructure, Terraform maintains a state for each deployment; to calculate required changes when the infrastructure is updated and also for destroying the infrastructure if it is no longer required. Goldstack by default will store the terraform state in the `infra/aws` folder as simple files.

This works well for deploying infrastructure from your local development environment but is not a good choice when building a CI/CD pipeline for the infrastructure definition. In that case, it is better to define [Remote State](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html). A popular choice many projects adopt here is to store the [state in an S3 bucket](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html). Please see the Terraform documentation for further details.
