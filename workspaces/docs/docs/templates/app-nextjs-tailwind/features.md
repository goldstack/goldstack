### Configured for TypeScript

Use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in your project. Configured to use a [TypeScript monorepo](https://maxrohde.com/2021/11/20/the-ultimate-guide-to-typescript-monorepos/) to easily combine front-end and back-end code in one repository.

### Jest and React Testing Library

Test the components and pages in your Next.js project using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

### Ready for Deployment to AWS.

Scalable AWS infrastructure defined in Terraform; all content served through the powerful CloudFront CDN and stored in S3 at very low costs.
