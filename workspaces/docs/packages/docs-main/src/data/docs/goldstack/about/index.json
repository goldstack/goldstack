  "html": "<p>Getting started with a new project often takes so much longer than it should. Rather than writing code for the problem we want to solve, we fiddle around with the tooling. This problem is often substantial especially in JavaScript ecosystems, where getting common tools such as ESLint, TypeScript, Jest and React work together takes a lot of time and can be frustrating.</p>\n<p>Goldstack provides high quality starter projects that are configured based on best practices and sensible defaults. Using a Goldstack starter project rather than a hand-rolled one, will save you dozens of development hours. Moreover, at Goldstack we obsess with every detail of our starter projects and have the freedom to spend the time on optimizing things; something often lost in the race to get goals delivered in many development projects.</p>\n<h2 class=\"heading\"><span id=\"design-principles\"></span><a href=\"#design-principles\">Design Principles</a><span class=\"permalink\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\">\n  <g stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"#000000\" stroke=\"#000000\">\n    <path fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" d=\"M8.995,7.005 L8.995,7.005c1.374,1.374,1.374,3.601,0,4.975l-1.99,1.99c-1.374,1.374-3.601,1.374-4.975,0l0,0c-1.374-1.374-1.374-3.601,0-4.975 l1.748-1.698\"></path>\n    <path fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" d=\"M7.005,8.995 L7.005,8.995c-1.374-1.374-1.374-3.601,0-4.975l1.99-1.99c1.374-1.374,3.601-1.374,4.975,0l0,0c1.374,1.374,1.374,3.601,0,4.975 l-1.748,1.698\"></path>\n  </g>\n</svg></span></h2>\n<p>Goldstack templates are based on the following design principles:</p>\n<h3 class=\"heading\"><span id=\"only-the-best-tech\"></span><a href=\"#only-the-best-tech\">Only the best tech</a><span class=\"permalink\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\">\n  <g stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"#000000\" stroke=\"#000000\">\n    <path fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" d=\"M8.995,7.005 L8.995,7.005c1.374,1.374,1.374,3.601,0,4.975l-1.99,1.99c-1.374,1.374-3.601,1.374-4.975,0l0,0c-1.374-1.374-1.374-3.601,0-4.975 l1.748-1.698\"></path>\n    <path fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" d=\"M7.005,8.995 L7.005,8.995c-1.374-1.374-1.374-3.601,0-4.975l1.99-1.99c1.374-1.374,3.601-1.374,4.975,0l0,0c1.374,1.374,1.374,3.601,0,4.975 l-1.748,1.698\"></path>\n  </g>\n</svg></span></h3>\n<p>We aim to provide starter templates for the best frameworks currently on the market.

Some of the elements that enable this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Infrastructure can be adapted to your needs utilizing the full power of Terraform</li>\n<li>Core functionality is defined as easy to change source code in the project</li>\n<li>Any dependencies we add to your project are available as open source and open for you to modify as required</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"heading\"><span id=\"modularity-first\"></span><a href=\"#modularity-first\">Modularity first</a><span class=\"permalink\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\">\n  <g stroke-width=\"1\" fill=\"#000000\" stroke=\"#000000\">\n    <path fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" d=\"M8.995,7.005 L8.995,7.005c1.374,1.374,1.374,3.601,0,4.975l-1.99,1.99c-1.374,1.374-3.601,1.374-4.975,0l0,0c-1.374-1.374-1.374-3.601,0-4.975 l1.748-1.698\"></path>\n    <path fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#000000\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-miterlimit=\"10\" d=\"M7.005,8.995 L7.005,8.995c-1.374-1.374-1.374-3.601,0-4.975l1.99-1.99c1.374-1.374,3.601-1.374,4.975,0l0,0c1.374,1.374,1.374,3.601,0,4.975 l-1.748,1.698\"></path>\n  </g>\n</svg></span></h3>\n<p>Modularity is one of the most important principles in software design.

For instance, it is possible to write a Jest test that uses React Testing Library to walk through the user interface while interacting with an in-memory API server (rather than having to mock calls to the backend).</p>",
