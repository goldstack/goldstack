# Roadmap

It should be a surprise to no one that setting up a dynamic monorepo for JavaScript/TypeScript projects is challenging. While the projects built with Goldstack have loads of config and best practices embedded, there is still a way to go to make this a complete turnkey solution. The following table gives an overview of what works well in the generated project and where some work may still be needed.

| Status | Feature                | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 👌     | Install and Build      | Yarn Workspaces using Yarn v2 (Berry) overall works very well and allows for very fast install and build speeds.                                                                                         |
| 👌     | TypeScript             | Well-supported, only workaround required is to run `yarn fix-project-references` when new inter-project dependencies are added.                                                                          |
| 👌     | Linting and Formatting | Biome are configured to work effectively across all packages.                                                                                                                              |
| 👌     | Testing                | Running tests with Jest works across all packages                                                                                                                                                        |
| 👌     | IDE Integration        | VSCode including Intellisense works across the monorepo                                                                                                                                                  |
| 🤷     | AWS                    | Deployment into AWS using Terraform overall works very well. Just initial configuration and the way credentials are provided can be improved. See [#3](https://github.com/goldstack/goldstack/issues/3). |
